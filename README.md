The paper is in **TKTK.pdf**.

The code that generates the results shared in the paper is contained `cde/`.
Data and figures are saved to `out/`.
A log file is saved to `log/`.


To replicate results,
code should -- for the most part -- be run in order of the program name.
The Python code needs to be run from the `cde/` directory because
it relies on relative paths.
I open up 

My installation of Python followed the steps described at [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/).
I relied on the following specifications:

|---------------------|----------------|
| conda version       | 23.1.0         |
| conda-build version | 3.23.3         |
| python version      | 3.9.16.final.0 |
|---------------------|----------------|

Code is contained in the following files.
